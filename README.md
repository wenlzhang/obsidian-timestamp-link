[![GitHub release (Latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/wenlzhang/obsidian-timestamp-link)](https://github.com/wenlzhang/obsidian-timestamp-link/releases) ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/wenlzhang/obsidian-timestamp-link/total?color=success)

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to copy timestamped links to blocks, headings and notes.

## Why You Need Timestamp Link

Have you ever considered how the connections you make in Obsidian can be enhanced with a simple yet powerful addition? When creating a knowledge base using the slip-box method, you link notes to uncover unexpected connections, but what if you could also capture the timing of those links?

### The Importance of Timing in Context

The inventor of the slip-box method, Niklas Luhmann, emphasized the need to create notes with the future in mind, as if for a stranger. This approach highlights the importance of context‚Äînot just the content of your notes, but also when they were created and linked. By adding timestamps to your note links, you enrich your knowledge base with valuable contextual information. You‚Äôll know not only what information is linked but also when those connections were made, providing deeper insights into your thought process over time.

### Why This Matters

By incorporating timestamps into your links, you‚Äôre not just creating connections; you‚Äôre building a narrative of your knowledge journey. This added layer of context that can help you:

- **Track the evolution of your thoughts**: Understand how your ideas have changed over time.
- **Enhance discoverability**: Quickly locate when specific connections were made, facilitating better retrieval of information.
- **Provide clarity for future reference**: Ensure that you and others can appreciate the context behind your links.

### Introducing Timestamp Link

Imagine being able to add timestamps to three different types of links within your notes. With the **Timestamp Link** plugin, you can effortlessly do just that:

1. **Block Links**: When you create a block link, you can include two timestamps that indicate when the link was created and inserted. The first timestamp captures the moment you created the block link, while a second timestamp records when you insert that link into another node, providing a clear timeline of your thought process. This redundancy allows you to track the evolution of your ideas.
2. **Note Links**: For links to existing notes, you can add a timestamp whenever you insert the link. This feature ensures that you can always reference when a particular connection was made, enhancing your understanding of how your knowledge has developed.
3. **Heading Links**: Similar to note links, heading links can also include timestamps upon insertion. This allows you to maintain a comprehensive timeline of your notes, making it easier to navigate your knowledge base.

[Obsidian Timestamp Link](https://exp.ptkm.net/obsidian-timestamp-link) was crafted with two [PTKM Core Principles](https://exp.ptkm.net/ptkm-core-principles) that shape its functionality:

- **Providing Context**: Ensuring no valuable information is lost
- **Linking Everything**: Allowing seamless navigation

By including timestamp information, you can easily see when each block link was created and when note links were inserted into the entry notes, enhancing your understanding of the timeline and evolution of your ideas.
