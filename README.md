An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to copy timestamped links to blocks, headings and notes.

## Features

- Copy timestamped links to blocks, and append text
    - E.g., `[[Note#^20230101120030]]`
    - E.g., `[[Note#^20230101120030]] üìù 2023-11-04T12:00`
- Copy timestamped links to headings, and append text
    - E.g., `[[Note#Heading]]`
    - E.g., `[[Note#Heading]] üìù 2023-11-04T12:00`
- Copy timestamped links to notes, and append text
    - E.g., `[[Note]]`
    - E.g., `[[Note]] üìù 2023-11-04T12:00`

## Use cases

- Adding timestamps to links provides context
    - For instance, in the slip-box method, one may create entry notes to accumulate notes (links) of similar topics. With timestamp information, can can see when the (block) links are created and inserted into the entry notes.

## Usage

Timestamp Link uses [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) to format the date and time to be appended.

- For example, if `20230101120030` is the desired text to be appended, then `YYYYMMDDHHmmss` needs to be configured in settings.
- In addition, **square brackets** are needed to surround the content that is not part of the format string.
- On the other hand, symboles such as `:` **cannot be used** in Obsidian as block IDs. Therefore, one should experiment the proper format for the timestamp.
